## üìò About

**my-JAVA-journey** is a personal log of my journey learning Java from scratch. This repository documents my progress as I explore Java programming concepts, from basic syntax to advanced topics. I update it regularly with code examples, explanations, and notes. My goal is to create a comprehensive resource that serves as a helpful guide for other beginners diving into Java.

## üöÄ Purpose

This project is designed to:

- Track my learning progress with practical code examples.
- Provide clear, beginner-friendly explanations of Java concepts.
- Serve as a future reference for myself and other learners.
- Encourage community feedback to improve the content.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized to reflect my learning progression:

- **/Topics**: Core Java concepts (variables, data types, loops, conditionals).
- **/Code_Base**: Practical code snippets and mini-projects.
- **/progress_log.md**: Documentated consistent learning journey.
- **resources.md**: Provided the resources from where i took refference.
- **/resources.md**: Markdown files with explanations and summaries of concepts.

*Note*: The structure may evolve as new topics are added.
