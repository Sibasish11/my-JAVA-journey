# Compiler vs Interpreter

A fundamental concept in programming is understanding how source code is executed â€” either through a **compiler** or an **interpreter**. Here's a side-by-side comparison:

| **Compiler** | **Interpreter** |
|--------------|------------------|
| Translates the file into machine language only once. | Translates the file every time you want to execute it. |
| Generates a separate machine code file. | Does not generate a separate machine code file. |
| Compiled files can run independently. | Interpreted programs cannot run independently. |
| Compiled files are faster. | They run inside the interpreter, so they are slower. |

âœ… Use a **compiler** when performance is critical.  
ðŸ”„ Use an **interpreter** during development or for rapid testing.
