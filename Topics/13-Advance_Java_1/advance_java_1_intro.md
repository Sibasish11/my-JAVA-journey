# Advance Java 1: Introduction

Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language that is widely used for developing various types of applications. While Core Java covers the basics such as OOP, data structures, and control flow, **Advance Java** refers to the concepts and libraries used for developing complex, enterprise-level, and web-based applications.

## 🔍 What is Advance Java?

Advance Java extends the capabilities of Core Java to build dynamic web-based applications. It mainly focuses on topics such as:

- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- Servlet API (for web-based development)
- JSP (Java Server Pages)
- Networking and Socket Programming
- Web Services (RESTful/SOAP)

Advance Java provides the backbone for **backend server development** in Java-based applications.
