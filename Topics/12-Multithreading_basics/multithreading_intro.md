# Introduction to Multithreading in Java

Multithreading is one of the core features of Java that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program. Each part of such a program is called a **thread**, and each thread defines a separate path of execution. It is especially useful in applications that require heavy tasks such as gaming, animations, simulations, or server-side processing.


## üß† Why Use Multithreading?

- **Efficient CPU utilization**: Threads can run in parallel on multi-core systems.
- **Improved application responsiveness**: UI applications stay responsive during long operations.
- **Simpler program structure**: Tasks can be logically separated using threads.
- **Resource sharing**: Threads share memory, reducing overhead.


## üîÅ Example from Daily Life

Think of a web browser:
- One thread loads the page.
- One plays background music.
- Another responds to user interactions.

All run simultaneously, yet are part of the same program.


## üßµ What is a Thread?

A **thread** is the smallest unit of execution in a program. In Java:
- Every program starts with a main thread.
- You can create additional threads for parallel tasks.


## üß∞ Key Components of Java Multithreading

| Concept            | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Thread` class     | Java's built-in class to define and control threads.                        |
| `Runnable` interface | Functional interface for defining the task to run inside a thread.        |
| `start()`          | Begins execution of a thread (calls `run()` method internally).             |
| `run()`            | Contains the logic/code that the thread will execute.                       |
| `sleep()`          | Pauses a thread for a defined duration.                                     |
| `join()`           | Forces one thread to wait until another completes.                          |


## üîÇ Single-threaded vs Multithreaded

| Feature                 | Single-threaded                         | Multithreaded                                  |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Execution               | One task at a time                     | Multiple tasks can run concurrently            |
| Performance             | Slower in resource-heavy tasks         | Faster when tasks are independent              |
| Complexity              | Easier to write and debug              | Requires careful synchronization               |


## ‚úÖ When NOT to Use Multithreading

- If your task is simple and sequential.
- If it heavily depends on shared resources (increased complexity).
- When tasks aren't CPU-bound and parallelism won‚Äôt help.


## üìå Summary

Multithreading enhances performance and responsiveness but also introduces complexity. It's important to understand when and how to use it properly.
