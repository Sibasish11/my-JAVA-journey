# JSP Syntax and Elements

JSP (JavaServer Pages) provides various types of syntaxes and tags that allow mixing Java code with HTML content. Understanding these basic syntax components is crucial to build dynamic web applications effectively.


## 1. **Directives**

Directives provide global information about the entire JSP page. They do not produce output but control how the page is processed.

## Types:
- page: Defines page-level instructions.
```java
<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" %>
```
- include: Includes static content during translation time.
```java
<%@ include file="header.jsp" %>
```
- taglib: Declares usage of custom tag libraries.
```java
<%@ taglib uri="..." prefix="..." %>
```
