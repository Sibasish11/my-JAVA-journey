# 🌟 Java Mastery Roadmap

Welcome to the **my_JAVA_journey** a structured and evolving path to becoming proficient in both Core and Advanced Java. This roadmap is crafted to guide learners from the very fundamentals to industry-level backend skills, enriched with problem-solving, real-world projects, and conceptual clarity.


## 🧱 Phase 1: Core Java Foundations (`/core_concepts`)
> Building a solid understanding of the building blocks of Java.

### 🔹 Topics Covered:
- Variables, Data Types, Operators
- Control Statements (if, switch, loops)
- Functions & Recursion
- Arrays & Strings
- Object-Oriented Programming
  - Classes, Objects, Constructors
  - Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction
  - Interface vs Abstract Class
- Exception Handling
  - Try-Catch, Throws, Finally, Custom Exceptions

🎯 **Problem Sets**: Focused on each OOP topic for practical reinforcement.


## 🧰 Phase 2: Java Collections & Utilities (`/topics/java_collections_1`, `/java_collections_2`, `/collections_utility`)
> Mastering built-in Java data structures and utility tools.

### 🔹 Collections 1
- List Interface (ArrayList, LinkedList)
- Set Interface (HashSet, TreeSet)
- Queue Interface (Queue, PriorityQueue)
- Iterators (Iterator & ListIterator)

### 🔹 Collections 2
- Map Interface (HashMap, TreeMap, Hashtable)
- Real-World Problems using Maps
- Performance Comparison

### 🔹 Collections Utility
- `Collections` class methods
- Sorting, Shuffling, Frequency, etc.

🎯 **Problem Sets**: Focused on ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, and Iteration.


## 🧵 Phase 3: Multithreading Basics (`/12-Multithreading_basics`)
> Understanding parallel execution and thread control.

- Threads using `Thread` & `Runnable`
- Thread Lifecycle
- Thread Priorities, Sleep, Join
- Synchronization & Locking
- Producer-Consumer Problem

🎯 **Mini Challenges**: Implement real multithreaded scenarios.


## 🧩 Phase 4: Exception Handling (`/topics/exception_handling`)
> Writing robust and fault-tolerant applications.

- Java Exception Model
- Try-Catch-Finally, Throws, Throw
- Built-in vs Custom Exceptions
- Exception Hierarchies
- Best Practices


## 💻 Phase 5: Java I/O Basics (`/topics/java_io_basics`)
> Handling files and input/output streams in Java.

- File Class
- Byte Streams (`FileInputStream`, `FileOutputStream`)
- Character Streams (`FileReader`, `FileWriter`)
- Buffered Streams
- Object Serialization


## 🌐 Phase 6: Advanced Java 1 – JDBC & Servlets (`/advance_java_1`)
> Connecting Java to databases and handling backend logic.

### 🔹 JDBC
- Introduction & Architecture
- Connectivity Steps
- Statements (Statement, PreparedStatement, CallableStatement)
- CRUD Operations

### 🔹 Servlets
- Lifecycle & Deployment
- ServletConfig & ServletContext
- Form Handling (GET/POST)
- Multiple Servlet Mapping


## 🌐 Phase 7: Advanced Java 2 – JSP & Web Tiers (`/14-Advance_java_2`)
> Creating dynamic web pages with embedded Java.

- JSP Syntax & Lifecycle
- Directives, Scriptlets, Declarations
- Form Handling via JSP
- JSP Implicit Objects
- Error Handling in JSP


## ⚒️ Code Base (`/code_base`)
> Real-world problems, mini-projects, and coding practice tailored to each phase.

- OOP Problems
- Collection-based Problems
- Multithreading Scenarios
- JDBC CRUD Projects
